## üêû Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Video doesn't autoplay
**Solution**: Autoplay with sound is blocked by browsers. The video is muted, which should allow autoplay. If it still doesn't work, it may be due to browser settings or Data Saver mode.

### Issue: Fonts look different
**Solution**: Clear browser cache. Fonts are now loading asynchronously, so there may be a brief moment where fallback fonts show.

### Issue: CSP blocks a resource
**Solution**: Check browser console for the blocked resource and add it to the CSP policy in index.html line 52.

### Issue: Portfolio filter doesn't work
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Ensure AOS library loaded successfully.

### Issue: Modal doesn't close
**Solution**: Check that modal JavaScript initialized. Look for errors in console.
