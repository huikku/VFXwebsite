## ü§ñ Customizing with AI Agents

This template is designed to be customized using AI coding agents. Here's how:

### Using Claude Code (Recommended)

This template was built entirely with Claude Code, so it works exceptionally well!

**Getting Started:**
1. Open the repository folder in Claude Code
2. Start a conversation: "Help me customize this portfolio"
3. Ask for specific changes in plain language

**Example Prompts:**

```
"Update the About section with my bio: I'm a VFX artist with 10 years of experience..."

"Change the color scheme from red to ocean blue throughout the entire site"

"Add 8 portfolio items with my YouTube video IDs: [list of IDs]"

"Update all the text content with my information from this document [paste]"

"Make the hero section taller and add a particle effect background"

"Optimize the site for better performance - make it load faster"
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific about what you want
- Provide examples or reference images
- Ask for explanations if you want to understand the changes
- Request the complete file instead of snippets for easier updates

### Using Cursor

1. Open folder in Cursor
2. Use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` for inline AI editing
3. Use `Cmd/Ctrl + L` for AI chat
4. Ask questions or request changes in natural language

**Example:**
- Highlight a section
- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
- Type: "Update this with my professional experience"

### Using Windsurf

1. Open folder in Windsurf
2. Open the AI chat panel (right sidebar)
3. Ask for changes or improvements
4. Review and accept the suggestions

### Using GitHub Copilot in VS Code

1. Open files in VS Code
2. Start typing comments describing what you want
3. Copilot will suggest code
4. Press Tab to accept suggestions

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Update hero section with my name John Smith and tagline Senior VFX Artist -->
```
Copilot will generate the HTML!

### Common AI Prompts for This Template

**Personalizing Content:**
```
"Replace all placeholder text with my information from this resume [paste]"
"Update the meta tags and SEO information for my portfolio"
"Add my social media links: LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, ArtStation"
```

**Design Changes:**
```
"Make the design more minimalist - remove the glitch effect"
"Add a dark mode toggle"
"Change the font to something more modern and clean"
"Make the portfolio grid show 4 items per row instead of 3"
```

**Adding Features:**
```
"Add a blog section that pulls from Medium RSS feed"
"Add Google Analytics tracking"
"Create a testimonials section with carousel"
"Add a downloadable resume button"
```

**Optimizations:**
```
"Make the site load faster"

## ‚úèÔ∏è Manual Customization

If you prefer to edit manually without AI:

### 1. Open in VS Code
- In GitHub Desktop: Repository ‚Üí Open in Visual Studio Code
- Or: File ‚Üí Open Folder in VS Code

### 2. Preview Locally
- Right-click `index.html`
- Select "Open with Live Server"
- Your site opens in browser with live reload

### 3. Edit Content

**index.html** - Update:
- Line 33: Page title
- Line 34: Meta description
- Lines 39-49: Social media preview tags
- Line 102: Your name in hero section
- Line 103: Your tagline
- Lines 124-131: About section (4 text blocks)
- Lines 135-230: Portfolio items (add your YouTube video IDs)
- Lines 252-309: Experience section
- Lines 320-358: Skills section
- Lines 394-417: Services section
- Lines 436-450: Contact form (update Formspree endpoint)

**css/main.css** - Customize:
- Lines 80-114: Color scheme (change `--color-primary` for main color)
- Fonts, spacing, animations, etc.

**js/main.js** - Advanced:
- Usually no changes needed
- All functionality works out of the box

### 4. Replace Media Files

**Images:**
- `images/artist_headshot.webp` - Your professional photo (200x200px recommended)
- `images/thumbnail_01.webp` through `thumbnail_16.webp` - Portfolio thumbnails

**Videos:**
- `videos/hero_loop.mp4` - Background video (keep it under 5MB)
- `videos/videoLoopStill_01.png` - Poster frame for video

**Tips for Media:**
- Use WebP format for images (smaller file size)
- Compress videos heavily - they're just backgrounds
- Keep total repository under 100MB

### 5. Production Optimization

For best performance, switch to minified files:

In `index.html`:
- Line 69: Change `css/main.css` ‚Üí `css/main.min.css`
- Line 505: Change `js/main.js` ‚Üí `js/main.min.js`

Minified files are 30-35% smaller!

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Site Not Deploying

**Check:**
- [ ] Repository is named `yourusername.github.io`
- [ ] Repository is set to Public
- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled (Settings ‚Üí Pages)
- [ ] Branch is set to `main` (not `master`)
- [ ] Files are in root directory (not in a subfolder)

**View deployment logs:**
1. Go to "Actions" tab on GitHub
2. Click latest deployment
3. Check for errors

### Images Not Showing

- Check file paths are correct (case-sensitive!)
- Verify files are committed and pushed
- Check browser console (F12) for 404 errors
- Ensure images are in `images/` folder

### Videos Not Playing

- Check YouTube video IDs are correct
- Ensure videos are Public or Unlisted (not Private)

- Update line 436 in `index.html` with your endpoint
- Format: `https://formspree.io/f/yourformid`

### Site Looks Different Locally vs Live

- Hard refresh on live site (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Wait 5 minutes for CDN to update

### AI Agent Not Working Well

**For best results:**
